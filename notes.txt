Radios for check boxes. Current forms are WAYYYYYY too long. people want short easy forms and thats what we will give them
    Options include:
        Climate controlled:
          Does it need to be heated or cooled?
          I dont care if it is stored in antartica
        Accessability:
          How many times can i access it in the contract period?:
            1 month, 3 months 6 months >> once a month? >> twice a month??
            Seller can specify? have the options allow "Can get your crap anytime, just give me a 48 hour notice"
            maybe through google calender, the seller and buyer could agree on appointments
        Pricing per month:
          Still up in the air
            could be a set your own price model
            probally better to have people follow standard pricing model that way if i get 10 ft ^3 for 20 bucks and my friend gets it for 15, i'm gonna be pissed
            BUUUTT if we both pay 17 bucks, everyone is happy
    *   Size of space? Standardized boxes:
            Either we can rent boxes oorrrrrrrr we can use standard dimensions for the trash boxes around campus? Big question

    Price sensitivity:
        People at a younger bracker (college) are going to be more suseptable to price swings than older guys who might see it as a deal?

    <strong>90/10 split is reasonable!!!!!!</strong>

    Name:
        maybe storaage!
        storage can be there
        garage gives a little bit of a negitive connotation but it could be a spinoff market for car storage.
        CONN-NO-TAYYY-SHON lolz

    Car storage expansion:
        much later but doable.
        who has extra space in their garage, driveway, lot, for cars to be parked??
